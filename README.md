# README Generator
  
## Description
  
  This is a command line app that will ask the user a series of questions in order to produce a well formatted, professional looking README file for any project they might create.

  ## Installation
  
  To install, begin by cloning the code into a desired location on the user's PC. Using command line, navigate into the develop folder. From there, type 'node index' and return/enter. The app will start.
  
  ## Usage
  
  The app accepts simple strings as answers. If an answer is empty, they will be prompted to enter that value again. After the README is created, it will appear in the 'dist' directory within the 'Develop' directory.

  ## How to Contribute
      
  Contributions on this project are currently closed, as it is completed for the forseeable future.
      
  ## Tests
      
  No pre-existing tests are in the code, but a user can test by creating an object of 'dummy answers' to then pass into the generateReadME function.
